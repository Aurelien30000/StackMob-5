# StackMob-5

StackMob redefined for 1.15 and 1.16. Uses NBT rather than databases/yaml files so performance will be greatly improved
compared to previous versions of StackMob.

Spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/stackmob-enhance-your-servers-performance-without-the-sacrifice.29999/

StackMob is a plugin that reduces the strain of mobs on your server by 'stacking' them together, therefore you can have
1 entity instead of 30 entities. StackMob aims to try and not break vanilla mechanics, however this is not always
pratical and/or possible.

It is recommended to use StackMob in conjunction with a farm limiter plugin for the best results.
